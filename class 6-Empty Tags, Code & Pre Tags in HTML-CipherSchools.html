        Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
        <br>
        And sorry I could not travel bothAnd be one traveler, 
        <br>
        long I stoodAnd looked down one as far as I could
        <br>
        To where it bent in the undergrowth;


        <p>
            Then took the other, as just as fair,
            <hr>
            And having perhaps the better claim,
        </p>


        <pre>

            Somewhere ages and ages hence:
            Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
            I took the one less traveled by,
            And that has made all the difference
